## 🚀 Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a modern **Job Board App** using **Next.js**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TailwindCSS**. You'll cover **real-world database relations, complex queries, and a complete CRUD workflow**, and implement **dynamic search filters** and **user applications**.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Next.js 15** – For building the React fullstack app with server components
* **Prisma** – For database ORM and relations
* **PostgreSQL** – As the relational database
* **TailwindCSS** – For styling with utility-first CSS
* **React Hooks** – For managing client-side state & interactivity
* **TypeScript** – Type safety and tooling
* **NextAuth** or custom session handling – For user authentication (depending on your implementation)

---

## ⚡️ Features

* 📝 **Post Job Offers**
  Authenticated users can post new job offers with title, description, type, and location.

* 🔍 **Advanced Search**
  Filter jobs by **keyword**, **type** (Full-time, Part-time, Contract), and **location** — all with Prisma query filters.

* 👤 **User Dashboard**
  Users can view their posted jobs and see how many applicants each job has received.

* ✅ **Job Applications**
  Users can apply for any job. The dashboard lists all applications with statuses.

* 🔄 **Dynamic Routes & Pages**
  Each job has its own dynamic detail page with full information and "Apply" button.

* 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization**
  Users must be signed in to post jobs or apply for them.
